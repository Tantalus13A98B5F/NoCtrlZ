# NoCtrlZ: Freeze `^z` in explorer to avoid disasters.

Taken from [this post](https://superuser.com/questions/268159/disable-ctrlz-shortcut-or-clear-undo-history-in-windows-explorer), to make it into a package. Can be seen as a shorter implementation of [dweundo](http://purl.org/net/dweundo) (and better, with a tray icon!), based on [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
